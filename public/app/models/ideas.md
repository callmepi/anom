# interesting projects

projects for brainstorming

## php ORM projects

* [riverside\php-orm](https://github.com/riverside/php-orm) seems the lightest and most promissing

* https://github.com/mareimorsy/DB

* https://propelorm.org/

* https://redbeanphp.com/index.php?p=/download

* you can find more in a [related github topic](https://github.com/topics/php-orm)


Thoughts:   
create a DatabaseModel class (??) based on the riverside\php-orm then use it in anom framerok


## php micro-framework

* [riverside\php-express](https://github.com/riverside/php-express) seems quite interesting
